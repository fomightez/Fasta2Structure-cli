    "Fasta2Structure prepares data in the specific format required by the population gentics software research program STRUCTURE that was developed by [Pritchard et al. 2000](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10835412/). See more about that software [here](https://web.stanford.edu/group/pritchardlab/structure.html) with [the current version of the STRUCTURE software (v. 2.3.4) and documentation available here](https://web.stanford.edu/group/pritchardlab/structure_software/release_versions/v2.3.4/html/structure.html).  \n",
    "Fasta2Structure is described in [Bessa-Silva 2024 'Fasta2Structure: a user-friendly tool for converting multiple aligned FASTA files to STRUCTURE format'](https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12859-024-05697-7).\n",

    "This notebook will demonstrate using a modified script Fasta2Structure in Jupyter and on the command line. The latter means it will be useful almost anywhere such as on remote machines or computer clusters. There is also the original Tkinter-based Python script by Adam Bessa you can run in your desktop, if you prefer. To try that in a virtual desktop without needing to install anything you own system [here](https://gist.github.com/fomightez/e65761a066f56cbbc4c9b5b882c87380) and find a step-by-step. It will not be as easy to use as the examples that I walk through in this Jupyter notebook file.\n",
